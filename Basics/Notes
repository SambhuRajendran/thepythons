Python Collections (Arrays)
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is unordered and changeable. No duplicate members.

\\Adding values to a list:
append() - add value to the end
insert() - listname.insert(index, "value")
extend() - This method can be used to add elements from one list to another
extend can also add values from other iterable objects (tuples, sets, dicts)
\\Removing values from a list:
pop() - removes the last value
pop(index) - will delete the value from tge specified index
del: del keyword can be used to remove a list entirely
example: del listname
Clear() - this can be used to empty the listt.
